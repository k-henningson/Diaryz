## Coding challenge:

### Build a simple reminder form & screen using React Native.
### Requirements:
* A user can create a reminder, a reminder only needs to be a string of text.
* A user can set a date and time for that reminder.
* A user can see a list of all the reminders they’ve created and when they will be reminded.
* A user can set a reminder to complete in that list.
* The data doesn’t need to persist, so no need for a backend or storage etc.
